**How to install**

1. Doubleclick on **MakeTi.bundle** pack.

2. You will need to set in Textmate the **ENV["ANDROID_SDK_PATH"]** variable.
To do this go to Preferences->Advanced->Shell variables, add a new variable named ANDROID_SDK_PATH and set the path to the AndroidSDK. (in my case is /android-sdk-mac_x86).

For now you still need to have the **bin** and **Makefile** from MakeTi in your project folder. 
Hopefully I'll be able to create a self-contained bundle.

Any help is welcomed :)
