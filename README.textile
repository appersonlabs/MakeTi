h1. MakeTi

h2. How to start the project

Add the files from this repo to the root dir of your project and type one of the following in a terminal:

<pre>$ make run</pre>

_* To change the SDK version, change the SDK version in your tiapp.xml._

<pre>$ make run</pre>

To run the application on Android, type:

<pre>$ make clean && make run platform=andorid</pre>

To run the application on iPad, type:

<pre>$ make clean && make run platform=ipad</pre>

The default platform is iPhone

_* You just have to use "make clean" before the run command if you change the device type. If you're using the same device between executions, it's not necessary to execute "make clean" because it will force Titanium to re-compile the entire project again, which is considerably slow._

h2. How to run on your device

To run your app on an iOS device you must simply add your development cert to <project dir>/certs/development.mobileprovision Creating the crets dir if needed.

After that, simply run
<pre>$ make deploy</pre>

To deploy the application on Android, type:

<pre>$ make clean && make deploy platform=andorid</pre>

To deploy the application on iPad, type:

<pre>$ make clean && make deploy platform=ipad</pre>

_* When you do a deploy on any iOS platform, it MakeTi will present to you a list of avaliable certs on your system, next to each cert is an id. you must re-run your deploy command using the cert you wish to use by adding cert=<id> to your command._

h2. Build and deploy directly to TestFlight

Simply run
<pre>$ make deploy testflight=true</pre>

Now before you do this, you will need to add 2 lines to your tiapp.xml file
You can also have the app auto distributed by setting a comma seperated list of distrabution lists

I also added an optional notes feature like so:
<pre>$ make deploy testflight=true notes="This is Beta 3 on my app"</pre>

That note will then be deliverd in the email to your beta testers informing them of the new app being ready to download.

_* Due to restrictions in the TestFlight API... if you dont set tf_dist in your Tiapp.xml... users wont get an email letting them know they can download till you go onto the testflight site and check them as users of the latest beta._

h2. How to install the Textmate bundle

1. Double-click on the **MakeTi.bundle** pack to install the bundle in Textmate.
2. Edit the ANDROID_SDK_PATH variablie in Textmate to the correct path of the Android SDK.
To do this go to _Preferences->Advanced->Shell variables_ add a new variable named **ANDROID_SDK_PATH** and set the path to the location of your Android SDK. (in my case is /android-sdk-mac_x86).
3. Open the whole project in Textmate.
B. Cmd+B within a file should open an option dialog letting you choose what to build for.

**Simulator only for now**
